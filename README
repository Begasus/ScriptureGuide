Scripture Guide 0.8.0

Scripture Guide (formerly Be-Logos) is a Bible program licensed under the GPL., based on the SWORD project.

Information on the SWORD Project can be found at http://www.crosswire.org/sword/

Help with using Scripture Guide can be obtained by starting the program and choosing 'Manual' from the Help menu.

Notes about this version:
0.8.0 is worlds apart from the previous version, and there has been much work in making this one better than the last one.

The manager for packages is still a work in progress, but it should work OK in most cases.

Those BeOS users familiar with Terminal will notice that grep 2.5.1 and wget 1.8.2 are included in this package. These are required by the Scripture Guide Book Manager until a more suitable method of downloading books is available.

Changes since 0.7.1:
Significant reduction in package size
Parallel verse comparison
Addition of ScriptureGuideManager for downloading books
Show/Hide display of verse numbers
Fast Navigation
Cleaned-up general appearance
Case-sensitive searches
New search window
Font selection panel
Internal storage changes
Many, many bugfixes
