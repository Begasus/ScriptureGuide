ScriptureGuide
=======================================

ScriptureGuide (formerly Be-Logos) is a Bible program licensed under the GPLv2, based on the SWORD library.
Information on the SWORD Project can be found at http://www.crosswire.org/sword/

Help with using Scripture Guide can be obtained by starting the program and choosing 'Manual' from the Help menu.

The manager for packages (ScriptureGuideManager) is still a work in progress, but it should work OK in most cases.

`awk` and `grep` are required by the Scripture Guide Book Manager until a more suitable method of downloading books is available.
